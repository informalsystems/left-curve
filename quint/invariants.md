## Data structures

The main data structures are trees and nodes, defined below.

### Nodes
```bluespec
type Child = {
    version: int,
    hash: Term_t,
}

type InternalNode = {
    left_child: Option[Child],
    right_child: Option[Child],
}

type LeafNode = {
    // In the implementation it is a hash of a key but in the Radix tree it is
    // just used as a key, so we use a list of bits and we treat it here just as
    // bytes
    key_hash: Bytes_t,
    value_hash: Bytes_t,
}

type Node =
    | Internal(InternalNode)
    | Leaf(LeafNode)

```

### Trees
```bluespec
type BitArray = List[int]
type Version = int
type NodeId = { version: Version, key_hash: BitArray }

type OrphanId = {
  orphaned_since_version: Version,
  version: Version,
  key_hash: BitArray
}

type TreeMap = NodeId -> Node

type Tree = {
  nodes: TreeMap,
  orphans: Set[OrphanId]
}
```

## Projections of trees at versions

Some invariants can consider the entire tree with all the different versions living on it, but most invariants need to work with a single tree (as per the standard tree definition) at a time. Therefore, we need some auxiliary definitions to help getting a single tree's state at a given version, which we call a tree map.

```bluespec
  pure def treeAtVersion(t: Tree, version: int): TreeMap = {
    // take the nodes for the current version...
    val startingNodes = nodesAtVersion(t.nodes, version)
    // ... and grow the tree by adding direct children
    val nodePool = nodesUpToVersion(t.nodes, version)
    0.to(MAX_HASH_LENGTH).fold(startingNodes, (treeNodes, _) => {
      addDirectChildren(treeNodes, nodePool)
    })
  }
```

We also keep track of the smallest unpruned version, so we check the invariant for the trees at all versions from that until the current one.

```bluespec apply_state_machine.qnt +=
  /// The set of unpruned tree versions that should be complete in the tree
  val activeTreeVersions: Set[int] =
    smallest_unpruned_version.to(tree.treeVersion())

  /// The set of active tree maps
  val activeVersionedTrees: Set[TreeMap] =
    activeTreeVersions.map(v => treeAtVersion(tree, v))
```

## Invariants

### Parents of nodes exist in the tree

In a tree, all nodes except from the root should have a parent. There should be no dangling nodes. If we find a node with key 1001, there should be a node for 100. At some other iteration, we'll also check that 100 has a parent (that is, 10), and so on.

*Status:* FALSE due to https://github.com/left-curve/left-curve/pull/291

```bluespec apply_state_machine.qnt +=
  /// Make sure the tree encoded in the map forms a tree (everyone has a parent, except for the root)
  /// E.g., if a node has keyhash_prefix [1,0,0,1] then there must be a node with keyhash_prefix [1,0,0]
  val everyNodesParentIsInTheTreeInv: bool = {
    pure def everyNodesParentIsInTheTree(t: TreeMap): bool = {
      val prefixes = t.keys().map(p => p.key_hash)
      prefixes.filter(p => p != []).forall(p => {
        val parent = p.slice(0, p.length() - 1)
        prefixes.contains(parent)
      })
    }

    activeVersionedTrees.forall(everyNodesParentIsInTheTree)
  }
```

### Two leafs have a node with a common prefix

For any pair of leafs on the tree, there should be another node such that its key hash is the common prefix of the key hashes of both leafs.

*Status:* TRUE

```bluespec apply_state_machine.qnt +=
  /// Invariant that checks that for any two leaf nodes, there is a nodeId in the
  /// tree that is the common prefix
  val nodeAtCommonPrefixInv: bool = {
    // Check whether there is a node with the given prefix
    pure def existsNode(t: TreeMap, b: Bytes_t): bool =
      t.keys().filter(nId => nId.key_hash == b).size() > 0

    // For any two leaf nodes, is there a nodeId in the tree that is the common prefix
    // of the nodes?
    pure def nodeAtCommonPrefix(t: TreeMap) : bool =
      t.allLeafs().forall(a =>
        t.allLeafs().forall(b =>
          (a.key_hash != b.key_hash) implies existsNode(t, commonPrefix(a, b))
      ))

    activeVersionedTrees.forall(nodeAtCommonPrefix)
  }
```

-->

### Leaf nodes should not be prefixes of any other node

Leafs should never be in the middle of a tree. If a there is a node with a key hash that is a prefix of the key hash of a leaf, then this is not a proper tree.

*Status:* FALSE due to https://github.com/left-curve/left-curve/pull/291

```bluespec apply_state_machine.qnt +=
  /// Make sure that the map encodes a tree. In particular, there is no internal node
  /// that has a leaf node as its prefix
  /// E.g., the map is not allowed to have: [0,0,1] -> internal node; [0,0] -> leaf node
  val noLeafInPrefixesInv: bool = {
    pure def noLeafInPrefixes(t: TreeMap): bool = {
      val nodes = t.keys().map(nId => nId.key_hash)
      val leafs = t.keys().filter(nId => t.get(nId).isLeaf()).map(nId => nId.key_hash)

      nodes.forall(node => {
        not(leafs.exists(leaf => node != leaf and leaf.prefix_of(node)))
      })
    }

    activeVersionedTrees.forall(noLeafInPrefixes)
  }
```
<!--

```
-->

### Internal nodes have at least one child

Internal nodes can have 1 or 2 children, but never 0. Otherwise, they would be a leaf with no value.

*Status:* TRUE

```bluespec apply_state_machine.qnt +=
  /// All nodes of type Internal have a child which is not None
  val allInternalNodesHaveAChildInv: bool = {
    pure def internalNodeHasAChild(n: InternalNode): bool = {
      n.left_child != None or n.right_child != None
    }

    pure def allInternalNodesHaveAChild(t: TreeMap): bool = {
      t.keys().forall(nId => {
        match t.get(nId) {
          | Internal(n) => internalNodeHasAChild(n)
          | Leaf(_) => true
        }
      })
    }

    activeVersionedTrees.forall(allInternalNodesHaveAChild)
  }
```
<!--

```bluespec apply_state_machine.qnt +=

```
-->

### Only children are internal nodes

This checks that collapsing works properly: there should never be an internal node with a single child where that child is a leaf. If it was a leaf, since there is no sibling, we should have collapsed it and make the internal node the leaf itself.

This also means that the three is dense, not sparse.

*Status:* TRUE

```bluespec apply_state_machine.qnt +=
  /// If a node has exactly one child, the child is an internal node
  /// (if it was a leaf, then the node itself would be the leaf)
  val densityInv: bool = {
    pure def isDense(t: TreeMap): bool =
      t.keys().forall(nId => {
        match t.get(nId) {
          | Internal(n) =>
            if (n.left_child == None and n.right_child != None) {
              // Only has right child, right child should be internal
              findNode(t, nId.key_hash.append(1)).isInternal()
            } else if (n.right_child == None and n.left_child != None) {
              // Only has left child, left child should be internal
              findNode(t, nId.key_hash.append(0)).isInternal()
            } else {
              // Has two children or none
              true
            }
          | Leaf(_) => true
        }
      })

    activeVersionedTrees.forall(isDense)
  }
```

### Versions of predecessors in path should be >= node version

When nodes are updated (inserted, deleted) they are given a new version, and so are all the predecessors in the tree. At the same time, subtrees that are not touched by an update maintain their version. As a result, if the tree is properly maintained, the parent of a node, should have a version that is greater than or equal to the version of the node.

*Status:* FALSE due to https://github.com/left-curve/left-curve/pull/291

```bluespec apply_state_machine.qnt +=
  /// Invariant: For every node has predecessors with higer (or equal) version
  /// (This could be rewritten to talk about direct predecessors only)
  val versionInv: bool = {
    pure def allPrefixes (l: List[a]): Set[List[a]] =
      0.to(l.length()).map(i => l.slice(0, i))

    // This invariant actually works on the whole tree rather than on a TreeMap
    tree.nodes.keys().forall(a =>
      allPrefixes(a.key_hash).forall(p =>
        tree.nodes.keys().exists(b =>
          p == b.key_hash and b.version >= a.version)))
  }
```

```
-->

### Internal nodes share the version with at least one child

Given the explanation around `versionInv` from above, we had the (wrong) intuition, that since updates always push their version up the tree, every internal node should have the version of at least one of it children. However, the intuition is misleading in the case of a delete, where a parent gets a new version, but there may not be a node at the spot where the deleted nodes had been. However, for reference, we keep the formula here as it might be useful for understanding in the future.

*Status:* FALSE, might not be an invariant at all

```bluespec apply_state_machine.qnt +=
  /// Every internal node must have at least one child with the same version
  /// This doesn't hold - should it?
  /// TODO: check why this doesn't hold even when there are no deletions (seed 0x61ec6acbe4eda)
  val denseVersionsInv: bool = {
    def denseVersions(t: TreeMap): bool = {
      t.keys().forall(nId => {
        match t.get(nId) {
          | Internal(n) =>
            val leftOK =
              match n.left_child {
                | Some(c) => t.keys().exists(a => a.key_hash == nId.key_hash.append(0) and a.version == nId.version)
                | None => false
              }
            val rightOK =
              match n.right_child {
                | Some(c) => t.keys().exists(a => a.key_hash == nId.key_hash.append(1) and a.version == nId.version)
                | None => false
              }
            or(leftOK, rightOK)
          | Leaf(_) => true
        }
      })
    }

    activeVersionedTrees.forall(denseVersions)
  }
```

### Orphans should not appear in trees after they are orphaned

Orphans are used for state pruning. The implicit intuition is that orphaned nodes can be pruned as they are not needed for any tree operation (including proof construction or verification) for versions after they became orphans. This invariant makes it explicit why it is safe to prune orphans: No orphan is part of a tree at a version after it became orphaned.

*Status:* TRUE

```bluespec apply_state_machine.qnt +=
  /// Orphan should not be at one of the version trees after it gets orphaned
  val orphansInNoTreeInv: bool = {
    tree.orphans.forall(o =>
      val nodeId = { version: o.version, key_hash: o.key_hash }
      o.orphaned_since_version.to(tree.treeVersion()).forall(ver =>
        not(tree.treeAtVersion(ver).keys().contains(nodeId))))
  }
```

-->

### Stored hashes are actual hashes

For all internal nodes, for each existing child, the hash should match the result of hashing the subtree under that child's key hash.

*Status:* TRUE

```bluespec apply_state_machine.qnt +=
  /// Check that for all internal nodes, if they have a hash stored for a child,
  /// then the hash is the hash of the actualy the subtree for the child
  val hashInv: bool = {
    pure def properlyHashed(t: TreeMap): bool = {
      t.keys().forall(nID => {
        match t.get(nID) {
          | Leaf(_) => true
          | Internal(n) => {
            match n.left_child {
              | None => true
              | Some(c) => c.hash == hash(t.findNode(nID.key_hash.append(0)))
            }
            and
            match n.right_child {
              | None => true
              | Some(c) => c.hash == hash(t.findNode(nID.key_hash.append(1)))
            }
          }
        }
      })
    }

    activeVersionedTrees.forall(properlyHashed)
  }
```
<!--

```bluespec apply_state_machine.qnt +=

```
-->

### Stored hashes are unique

We use an implementation of hashes that ensure no collision, since no collision of hashes is an assumption we can make. This invariant is a sanity check that the hashes that get saved in the child nodes are unique.

*Status:* TRUE

```bluespec apply_state_machine.qnt +=
  /// All children in the tree should have different hashes
  val uniqueHashesInv: bool = {
    pure def uniqueHashes(t: TreeMap): bool = {
      pure val hashes = t.values().fold([], (acc, node) => {
        match node {
          | Internal(n) => {
            pure val acc_1 = match n.left_child {
              | None => acc
              | Some(c) => acc.append(c.hash)
            }
            match n.right_child {
              | None => acc_1
              | Some(c) => acc_1.append(c.hash)
            }
          }
         | _ => acc
        }
      })
      pure val uniqueHashes = hashes.foldl(Set(), (acc, hash) => {
        acc.union(Set(hash))
      })

      hashes.length() == uniqueHashes.size()
    }

    activeVersionedTrees.forall(uniqueHashes)
  }
```

### Node ids for tree maps have unique key hashes

While the overall tree receives an entry for the same `key_hash` whenever the corresponding value changes in a new version; in the versioned tree, each node should contain at most one entry for each `key_hash`.

*Status:* TRUE

```bluespec apply_state_machine.qnt +=
  /// The treemaps we use in the invariants should have unique key_hashes
  /// This is a sanity check for the treeAtVersion computation
  val goodTreeMapInv: bool = {
    pure def goodTreeMap(t: TreeMap): bool =
      t.keys().forall(a =>
        t.keys().forall(b => a.key_hash == b.key_hash implies a.version == b.version))

    activeVersionedTrees.forall(goodTreeMap)
  }
```
<!--

```bluespec apply_state_machine.qnt +=

```
-->

### Tree maps are bijective

Just as `key_hashes` in the invariant above, all nodes saved in the values of a tree map should be unique. This also mean that the mapping between node ids and nodes is bijective.
We can simply check that the sizes of keys and values is the same, since keys are already guaranteed to be unique by Quint's `Map` data structure.

*Status:* FALSE due to https://github.com/left-curve/left-curve/pull/291

```bluespec apply_state_machine.qnt +=
  /// TreeMap is a bijection: we can map keys to values but also values to keys
  /// In other words, values are also unique
  /// Only works on tree map, as trees can have same nodes in different keys/versions
  val bijectiveTreeMapInv: bool = {
    pure def bijectiveTreeMap(t: TreeMap): bool =
      t.keys().size() == t.values().size()

    activeVersionedTrees.forall(bijectiveTreeMap)
  }
